p2: SMS, iMessage, Wechat, and WhatsApp are all smartphone real-time messaging systems. After doing some research on the Internet, for each of these systems write one paragraph about the protocols they use. Then write a paragraph explaining how they differ.

SMS  (Short  Message Service) is a technology that allows the sending and  receiving of text  messages  between  mobile  phones  over  cellular  networks.  SMS is  realized  through  the  Mobile  Application  Part  (MAP)  of  the  SS#7  protocol,  and  the Short Message protocol is defined by 3GPP TS 23.040 and 3GPP TS 23.041. In addition, MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) extends the capability of original text messages, and support sending photos, longer text messages, and other content.  

iMessage is  an instant messenger service developed by Apple. iMessage supports texts, photos, audios or videos that we send to iOS devices and Macs over cellular data network or WiFi. Appleâ€™s iMessage is based on a proprietary, binary protocol APNs (Apple Push Notification Service). It sets up a Keep-Alive connection with the Apple servers. Every connection has its own unique code, which acts as an identifier for the route that should be used to send a message to a specific device. The connection is encrypted with TLS using a client-side certificate, that is requested by the device on the activation of iMessage.

WhatsApp  Messenger  is  an  instant  messenger  service  that  supports  many  mobile platforms  such  as  iOS,  Android,  Mobile  Phone,  and  Blackberry.  WhatsApp  users  can send each other unlimited images, texts, audios, or videos over cellular data network or WiFi. WhatsApp uses the XMPP protocol (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol). 

WeChat is a Chinese multi-purpose instant messaging, social media and mobile payment app developed by Tencent. The application uses a proprietary encryption protocol called as MMTLS for most of its communications. It is designed based on Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 drafts for both performance and security.



iMessage  and  WhatsApp  are  different  from  SMS  because  they  use  data  plan  to  send messages and they work on TCP/IP networks, but SMS use the text messaging plan we purchase from our wireless carrier. Moreover, iMessage and WhatsApp support sending photos,  videos,  files,  etc.,  while the  original SMS  can  only send  text  message.  Finally, iMessage and WhatsApp can work via WiFi, but SMS cannot.

WeChat attaches great importance to security and use encryption protol, which is different from others.
